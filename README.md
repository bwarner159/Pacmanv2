# Pacmanv2

# Brett Warner, Ryan Pottinger, Justice Collier
# The original author of the program was user Absor on GitHub. 
We have changed a few things, which include adding randomness to the pellets that Pac-man picks up. When he picks them up,there is a 15% chance that the ghosts will not become "scared." Speeds are now randomized, so the ghosts' speed can change fromeach game. The enemy types are now random from each game. The game is techincally "finished" with large help to the original author but we would like to add a few more things including a main menu, high scores, and a few more randomized capabilities to make sure that the game is different each time and there is a different user experience each time.
